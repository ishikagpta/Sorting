# Sorting
Project from Applied Algorithmics/Data structures, algorithms, and discrete math course

Summary

You will writea program which implements the following sorts and compares the performance for operations on listsof integers of growing sizes10, 100, 1000, 5000, 10000, 25000, etc....  You will graph the performance of the different sorts as a function of the size of the list.

1)BubbleSort

2)InsertionSort

3)MergeSort

4)Non-Recursive, one extra listMergeSort (Weâ€™ll call this improved version IterativeMergeSortfrom here on out in this homework)

5)QuickSort

6)ShellSort
